System Capabilities
-------------------

**Ingredient Retrieval**  
Plan and execute obstacle-free, efficient trajectories using visual input and real-time mapping to locate and retrieve ingredients.

**Collaborative Cooking Execution**  
Execute structured cooking actions such as mixing, cutting, and pouring. The robot maintains a dynamic internal model of recipe progress and updates it during task execution.

**Intelligent Action Planning**  
Determine the next step based on current task state and execution history. Incorporate verbal input and resolve conflicts between planned actions and user instructions.

**Voice Command Interpretation**  
Continuously listen for verbal input. Accurately interpret spoken commands and decide whether to accept, override, or reject based on current context.

**Object Recognition and Localization**  
Identify and localize tools and ingredients within the workspace using the onboard vision system.

**Completion and User Notification**  
Confirm that all recipe steps are completed and notify the user via speech when the meal is ready.
